## Welcome to My Project

### We Created a Contact Form in  Angular JS using the style guide.

>The Form had the following fields : name, email, website and message. The form also has a submit button. As the user is typing, it should validate all of the form fields and show any and all errors in the form data.

>Errors to be displayed

- Name cannot be left empty
- Email cannot be left empty
- Email must contain an @
- Website cannot be left empty
- Website must start with http:// or https:// - help
- Message cannot be left empty

>Once the form is filled out, the info is sent to Parse.
